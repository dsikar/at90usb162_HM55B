YAAC AT90USB162 HM55B

I call the board I use a Yaac - Yet Another Arduino Clone.

It's based on the AT90USB162. I'm looking at making cheap Arduinos
and that was the first result.

I've documented the Yacc on the London Hackspace Wiki, where it was
developed:

http://wiki.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Projects/YAAC

Steps for running sketches on the Yaac are described. It is based 
primarily on the Teensy, another device based on the AT90USB162
capable of running sketches.

I use the dfu-programmer to burn hex code onto the device.

I made a minor modification to obtain the first and last elements
of the raw and offsets arrays, this allows linear interpolation 
for angles near +-180 degrees.
